## Build & Run

```bash
beamtalk build       # Compile to BEAM bytecode
beamtalk repl        # Interactive development (auto-loads package)
beamtalk test        # Run BUnit tests
```

## Beamtalk Syntax Basics

```beamtalk
// Variables
x := 42
name := "hello"

// Message sends
x factorial              // unary
3 + 4                    // binary
list at: 1 put: "value"  // keyword

// Blocks (closures)
square := [:x | x * x]
square value: 5          // => 25

// Classes
Object subclass: Counter
  state: count = 0

  increment => self.count := self.count + 1
  count => self.count
```

## Development Workflow

The `.mcp.json` MCP server provides a persistent REPL session. Use it as
your primary development environment — not CLI commands.

**Session startup:**

1. Call `describe` to discover available operations
2. Call `load_project` with `include_tests: true` to load all source + tests
3. On a new codebase, read the language guide at https://www.beamtalk.dev/docs/language-features

**Edit → Reload → Test → Debug loop:**

1. Edit a `.bt` source file
2. `evaluate: 'Workspace load: "path"'` or `evaluate: "ClassName reload"`
   — or `load_project` again after multi-file edits
3. `test` with class name or file path — fast, no recompile
4. `evaluate` to debug failures — bindings preserved from prior calls
5. Only use CLI `beamtalk test` as a final full-suite check before committing

**Useful eval commands:**
- `Beamtalk help: ClassName` — class docs
- `Workspace load: "path"` — load a file
- `ClassName reload` — reload a changed class
- `Workspace classes` — list loaded classes

**Why MCP over CLI:**
- Classes stay loaded — no fresh compile each time
- Local bindings preserved — debug state carries across tool calls
- Faster iteration — reload one class, not rebuild everything

## Live Workspace (MCP)

The `.mcp.json` in this project configures the `beamtalk` MCP server, which gives
you live access to a running REPL. Claude Code starts it automatically via
`beamtalk-mcp --start` — no manual `beamtalk repl` required.

**Prefer MCP tools over guessing.** If you're uncertain what a method returns or
whether code is correct, evaluate it directly rather than inferring from source.

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `describe` | First call — discover operations and protocol version |
| `load_project` | Session startup — load all source + test files |
| `evaluate` | Test expressions, debug, call Workspace/Beamtalk APIs |
| `test` | Run tests by class name or file path |
| `complete` | Autocompletion suggestions |
| `search_examples` | Find patterns and working code (offline) |
| `show_codegen` | Inspect generated Core Erlang |
| `inspect` | Examine a live actor's state |

## Code Style

- **Always add type annotations** using `::` syntax on state declarations, method parameters, and return types
- State: `state: count :: Integer = 0`
- Parameters: `createExecution: execution :: WorkflowExecution =>`
- Return types: `count -> Integer => self.count`
- Nullable fields with `= nil` may omit the type if genuinely untyped
- **Always add doc comments** (`///`) on all classes and meaningful methods, with examples
- Class-level: describe purpose, responsibility, and key invariants
- Method-level: describe behavior, params, return value, and include a usage example
- Example:
  ```beamtalk
  /// Append events to a workflow's history, auto-assigning eventIds.
  ///
  ///   store appendEvents: "wf-1" events: #(ExduraEvent new)
  ///   // => #(ExduraEvent(eventId: 1, ...))
  appendEvents: workflowId :: String events: newEvents :: List =>
  ```
- **Always run `beamtalk fmt` before committing** — CI enforces `beamtalk fmt-check`

## Actor Design Notes

- **Inherited self-sends work** but go through a slower fallback path (hierarchy walk via `beamtalk_dispatch:super/5` instead of direct `__sealed_*` calls). **Caution:** inherited self-sends inside blocks can interact with the `calling_self` deadlock-prevention mechanism.
- **Actor subclass state field access works as designed** — `parent:init()` populates inherited fields in the state map. However, **non-Actor Object subclasses** (one class per file) have a bug: `collect_inherited_fields` can't find the parent, so inherited state is missing from the map.
- **Objects have no state** — `Object` is for stateless behavior only. Use `Value` for immutable data (auto-generates getters, `withX:` setters, equality). Use `Actor` when mutable state is needed.
- **Prefer composition over deep Actor inheritance** — avoids deadlock risks in block contexts and keeps responsibilities clear. E.g. the `run:ctx:` pattern where a WorkflowContext actor is passed to workflows.

## Essential Patterns

### Class Hierarchy

```beamtalk
// Immutable data — auto-generates getters, withX: setters, keyword constructor, equality
Value subclass: Point
  state: x = 0
  state: y = 0

// Mutable state — manual getters/setters, self.field := works
Object subclass: Config
  state: raw = nil

// Concurrent process — gen_server backed, async casts with !
Actor subclass: Server
  state: count = 0

// OTP supervision tree — for long-running services
Supervisor subclass: MyApp
  class strategy => #oneForOne
  class children => #(DatabasePool, HttpServer, Worker)
```

Rules:
- Pure data → `Value`
- Mutable but not concurrent → `Object`
- Concurrent process → `Actor`
- Long-running service with child processes → `Supervisor` with `beamtalk run`

### String Escaping

| Syntax | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `"hello {name}"` | String interpolation |
| `"literal \{ brace \}"` | Escaped braces |
| `"She said ""hello"""` | Escaped double-quote |

### Destructuring and match:

```beamtalk
// Tuple destructuring (critical for Erlang FFI)
{#ok, content} := Erlang file read_file: "path"

// Array destructuring
#[a, b] := #[10, 20]

// Map destructuring
#{#x => x, #y => y} := someDict

// match: with clauses
value match: [
  #ok -> "success";
  #error -> "failure";
  _ -> "unknown"
]
```

### Key Stdlib Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `System` | `getEnv:`, `osPlatform`, `pid` |
| `Subprocess` | Sync subprocess with stdin/stdout |
| `ReactiveSubprocess` | Push-mode subprocess with delegate callbacks |
| `Supervisor` | OTP supervision trees for service applications |
| `HTTPClient` / `HTTPServer` | HTTP client and server |
| `File` | Filesystem operations |
| `Json` / `Yaml` | Serialization |

### Critical Gotcha — Block Mutations

```beamtalk
// WRONG on Value/Object — assignment inside block doesn't propagate
count := 0
items do: [:x | count := count + 1]  // count is still 0!

// CORRECT — use inject:into:
count := items inject: 0 into: [:acc :x | acc + 1]
```

## Not Smalltalk — Common Pitfalls

Beamtalk looks like Smalltalk but has important differences. The compiler will
catch most of these, but they waste time:

| Smalltalk habit | Beamtalk equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `\| temp \|` temp var declarations | Just use `:=` directly | No declaration syntax |
| Trailing `.` on every statement | Newline is the separator | `.` is optional; use it only to disambiguate cascades |
| `"this is a comment"` | `// this is a comment` | Double-quoted strings are data, not comments |
| `^value` on last expression | Just write `value` | `^` is early-return only; last expr is implicitly returned |
| Left-to-right binary (`2+3*4=20`) | Standard math precedence (`2+3*4=14`) | `*` binds tighter than `+` |
| `'hello', name` concatenation | `"hello {name}"` interpolation | `++` also works: `"hello" ++ name` |
| `[:x \| \|temp\| temp := x]` block locals | `[:x \| temp := x]` | No block-local declarations |
| `:` for type annotations | `::` (double-colon) | `state: x :: Integer = 0`, `param :: Type -> ReturnType =>` |
| Unknown message raises error | Same — DNU raises `does_not_understand` error | Use `respondsTo:` to check before sending |

**`^` in blocks is a non-local return (exits the enclosing method):**

```beamtalk
// ^ inside a block exits the METHOD, not just the block:
firstPositive: items =>
  items do: [:x | x > 0 ifTrue: [^x]].   // ^ returns from firstPositive:
  nil   // reached only if no positive element found
```

**DNU raises a `does_not_understand` error.** Sending a message a class
doesn't implement raises a structured error — not a silent `false`. Use
`respondsTo:` or `evaluate` in the live workspace to confirm a method exists
before calling it.

**Implicit return rule:** the last expression of a method body is always its
return value. Never write `^` on the last line — only use it for early exits
inside the method:

```beamtalk
// Wrong — redundant ^
max: other =>
  ^(self > other ifTrue: [self] ifFalse: [other])

// Correct
max: other =>
  self > other ifTrue: [self] ifFalse: [other]

// Correct use of ^ for early return
safeDiv: other =>
  other = 0 ifTrue: [^0].
  self / other
```
